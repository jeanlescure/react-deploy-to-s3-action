# React Deploy to S3 Github Action

Sync a built React application to an AWS S3 repository.

## Usage

This action runs the equivalent of this oversimplified example:

```sh
$ aws s3 sync build s3://your.website.com/
```

But it sets sensible cache headers so that re-deploys cause changes to get picked up.

- /index.html - Cachable for 5 seconds. This is so we never hit the S3 bucket hard under high load (unlikely).
- /static/* - Cachable forever.
- /* - Cachable for a day.

With the previous in mind:

 1 - Place in your .github/workflows directory a `.yml` similar to the following:

```yml
name: Upload Website

on:
  push:
    branches:
    - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@main
    - uses: oxctl/react-deploy-to-s3-action@main
      with:
        args: --acl public-read --follow-symlinks --delete
      env:
        NODE_ENV: development # optional: defaults to production
        AWS_S3_BUCKET: ${{ variables.AWS_S3_BUCKET }}
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ variables.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
        AWS_REGION: eu-west-1 # optional: defaults to us-east-1
        SOURCE_DIR: bundle # optional: defaults to public
```

### Configuration

The following settings must be passed as environment variables as shown in the example.
Sensitive information, especially `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, should be
[set as encrypted secrets](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#creating-and-using-secrets-encrypted-variables) â€” otherwise, they'll be public to anyone browsing your repository's source code and CI logs.
